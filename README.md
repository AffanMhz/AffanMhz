## 👨‍🚀 About Me

I'm an **Embedded Systems Engineer** and **Space Technology Enthusiast** passionate about humanity's expansion into the solar system. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge embedded systems and the harsh realities of space exploration, developing robust solutions for spacecraft attitude control, orbital logistics, and autonomous systems that will enable our species to become truly interplanetary.

When I'm not optimizing sensor fusion algorithms for CubeSats or designing cargo management systems for space stations, you'll find me contemplating the elegance of orbital mechanics and dreaming about the first human settlements on Mars.

```python
class SpaceEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Affan"
        self.mission = "Enabling humanity's journey to become a multi-planetary species"
        self.core_skills = ["Embedded Systems", "Robotics", "Space Technology", "Frontend Dev"]
        self.philosophy = "Every line of code is a step toward the stars"
        
    def current_projects(self):
        return [
            "🛰️ ADCS Systems for CubeSat Missions",
            "🚀 Cargo Stowage Optimization for Space Stations", 
            "🌌 Orbital Mechanics Simulation Engines",
            "🔧 Embedded Systems for Space-Grade Applications"
        ]
        
    def dream_destination(self):
        return "The surface of Mars, debugging code under alien skies 🔴"

## 🌌 Fun Facts About This Space Engineer

- **🔴** I genuinely believe the first person to debug code on Mars has probably already been born
- **🛰️** I can calculate orbital periods in my head (seriously, try me with any planet!)
- **⚡** My code has been tested in conditions ranging from -40°C to +85°C (space is harsh!)
- **📡** I once stayed up 72 hours straight troubleshooting why a gyroscope was drifting... turned out it needed calibration
- **🌍** I track the ISS daily and wave when it passes overhead (the astronauts probably don't see me, but I like to think they appreciate the gesture)
- **🚀** My dream vacation destination is the Lagrange Point L1 - perfect view of both Earth and the Sun
- **🔧** I believe every embedded system should be designed as if it might one day operate in the vacuum of space
- **📚** I read mission reports from Apollo, Voyager, and Mars rover missions for fun
- **⭐** I can name more exoplanets than most people can name countries
- **🌌** When people ask me what I do, I say "I write code that works in places where humans can't survive"
